\subsection*{How it is related to the jet stream?}
\subsection*{what are differences between the polar jet
stream and the subtropical jet stream}
\section*{Idealized jet streak}
Sketch an idealized jet streak circulation. 
\subsection*{Where do convergence and divergence occur?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item at which levels
    \item how is that related to regions where cyclones arise preferably
\end{itemize} 
\section*{What role do polar fronts (or precisely polar front folds) play for exchange processes between troposphere and stratosphere? }
\section*{What is the influence on ozone and water vapor concentration?}
\section*{What is a dry intrusion?}
\section*{How are they related to strongly enhancing cyclones?}
You can relate this to potential vorticity.
